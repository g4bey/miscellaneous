# unfinished_classical_mecanics_project
This was a bonus assignment but I started working on it two hours before it was due... 

The program is working quite well. The only problem is the plotting which has unexpected behaviors.
I did not really have the time to read the documentation since I only had a few minutes left.

I gave up and may someday finish it if I ever use pyplot (likely)

Next time I will read the documentation LOL
